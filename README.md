# Dark Souls Twitch Overlay

A Dark Souls–style Twitch overlay that displays cinematic **“YOU DIED”** messages on stream, triggered directly from Twitch chat.

The overlay connects anonymously to a Twitch channel using **tmi.js**, listens for the `!ds` command from authorized users, and shows a full-width animated banner with sound and visual effects.
